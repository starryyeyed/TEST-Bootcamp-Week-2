            </h3>
            <p>
                1 ½ cups white sugar

                ¾ cup all-purpose flour

                ½ cup high-quality unsweetened cocoa powder

                ½ teaspoon salt

                ¼ teaspoon baking powder

                ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted

                3 large eggs

                1 teaspoon vanilla extract

                32 chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®), divided

                1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed

                Directions
            </h3>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch square baking pan.

                Mix sugar, flour, cocoa powder, salt, and baking powder together in a mixing bowl.

                Whisk butter, eggs, and vanilla together in a separate bowl. Add butter mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well combined.

                Pour 1/2 of the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth out with a spatula. Add 16 OREO® cookies in an even layer (4 rows of 4 cookies), then spread the remaining 1/2 of the batter over top.

                Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown and center is set, 30 to 35 minutes.

                Remove pan from the oven and set on a wire rack. Let brownies cool completely, at least 30 minutes.

                Crush 12 of the remaining OREO® cookies. Place the whipped topping in a bowl and fold in the crushed cookies. Spread over the top of the brownies. Crush the remaining 4 cookies, then sprinkle over the top of the whipped cream mixture.

                Keep refrigerated until you are ready to slice and serve.
